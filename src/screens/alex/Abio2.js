                                         In the period 1940-1955, A. Matchavariani wrote a lot of chamber music for piano, violin, choir and vocal music. Many of these compositions became the jewellery of Georgian and Soviet music.

Matchavariani a stunning success in Georgia, in Moscow ("Bolshoi"), in Leningrad (at “Kirov” theater), in many cities of the former USSR, in USA, in Paris, in Japan, in Finland, in Germany, in Romania and many other places. With "Othello", it is the end of one chapter in a musical language of A. Matchavariani and beginning of a new musical expression.
                         In 1960 he started another big composition, it is “Hamlet”, an opera in two acts. This work continues until 1967. The opera was prohibited by Georgian authority’s.

Matchavariani has started a new musical language and the much more modern way of expressing his musical ideas, together with a new way of designing his score. With symphony №2 he continues his new musical language.1972. The critics have baptized this symphony as a beginning of the PHILOSOPHICAL SYMPHONISM in Georgia .
                         In 1977 A. Matchavariani wrote probably the most important composition for him. It is ballet “The Knight in the tiger skin”, the poem of the 12-th century of the greatest Georgian poet and philosopher S. Rustaveli, pride of Georgia . It’s first production was in Leningrad , at “Kirov”(Mariisky) theatre, choreographer O. Vinogradov. The “Knight” had a great success in Leningrad (during 7 years) Moscow , USA , Paris , Japan , Tbilisi and many other places.
                         After writing a number of chamber, choral and vocal music, in 1979 he wrote a musical comedy “The Bug” after V. Mayakovsky. In 1983 Matchavariani has finished №3 and №4 symphonies. №3 Symphony is a composition of a huge power, deep and tender. The critic wrote about it: It is universal and human, cosmic and earthy. №4 symphony “The Youth’s” for strings, percussion, piano, celesta and harp is a sparkling, melodic, lyrical, motor composition with electric dynamism.
