                         12)    If it works it is because of the stark lighting and fairly robust account of the score under conductor Vakhtang Matchavariani, his control of the orchestra revealed Bartok’s overlap with Wagner and Janácek imaginatively enough. Scotland on Sunday. U.K. JOHN MARRIOTT.
